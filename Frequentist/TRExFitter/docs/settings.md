# Settings for TRExFitter blocks

## Standard fit
The following settings are for normal fits, performed without the action `m`. The `Job` block subcategories are provided only to make the reading of the settings easier and *should not* be used in the config file.

### `Job` block settings
| **Option** | **Function** |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| **General**                  | |
| Label                        | the label which will be shown on plots, if 'none' is set, no label will be shown |
| POI                          | the name of the parameter of interest; this should correspond to a NormFactor defined below. It is possible to define more than one POI, as a comma-separated list |
| ReadFrom                     | can be HIST or NTUP; default is HIST |
| Lumi                         | value to scale all the "NormalizedByTheory" samples |
| LumiScale                    | additional value to scale 'after' histogram creation (for fast scaling) IMPORTANT: use it only if you know what you are doing!! |
| DebugLevel                   | 0 = prints only Warning and Errors, 1 = additionally prints Info messages, 2 = additionally prints Debug messages, >2 additionally prints Verbose messages. For option <2 RooFit/Roostats messages will be heavily suppressed |
| Logo                         | is set to TRUE will print the `TRExFitter` logo |
| HistoChecks                  | NOCRASH: means that if an error is found in the input histograms, the code continues (with only warnings) -- default leads to a crash in case of problem, if set to NOCRASH, also prints warning instead of error (and crash) when input files are not found for the histogram building step |
| SplitHistoFiles              | set this to TRUE to have histogram files split by region (useful with many regions and/or run in parallel) |
| ImageFormat                  | png, pdf or eps |
| SmoothingOption              | Choose which smoothing option to use, allowed parameters are: MAXVARIATION (default), TTBARRESONANCE (see also [FAQ section](faq.md)), COMMONTOOLSMOOTHMONOTONIC, COMMONTOOLSMOOTHPARABOLIC, TCHANNEL, KERNELRATIOUNIFORM, KERNELDELTAGAUSS or KERNELRATIOGAUSS. |
| CorrectNormForNegativeIntegral | By default, if there are samples with negative yields in some bins, the total integral over that sample will be re-scaled after the yield in the negative bins was corrected to 1e-6, such that the total yield across the sample in this region is consistent with the yield before fixing the negative bins. If this option is set to TRUE (by default, it is FALSE), then this re-scaling will also happen if the total yield initially was negative. This can lead to unexpected behavior (expert option, proceed with caution). |
| MergeUnderOverFlow           | if set to TRUE, the underflow content of each histogram is added to the first bin and the overflow to the last one (default is FALSE for HIST inputs and TRUE for NTUP inputs) |
| SuppressNegativeBinWarnings  | If set to TRUE, will suppress warning messages about negative or 0 content in bins |
| Bootstrap                    | (only works with NTUP inputs) if set, the bootstrap method wil be used; the argument should be a string like `bsWeight(BootstrapIdx,eventNumber,mcChannelNumber)`, where `bsWeight` should be loaded with `CustomFunctions: "bsWeight.C"` and eventNumber and mcChannelNumber should be existing branches for all the MC ntuples; then, to produce the i-th bootstrap pseudo-experiment, or to run on it (e.g. to perform a fit) the command-line option `BootstrapIdx=<i>` should be given, with `<i>=0,1,2,3...`. Alternatively there is default function `util/BootstrapDefault.C` which would be called as `BootstrapDefault(eventNumber+mcChannelNumber+BootstrapIdx)`. |
| BootstrapSyst                | Specifies the systematics for which should be the bootstrap done. |
| BootstrapSample              | Specifies the sample for which should be the bootstrap done. Nominal and all correlated systematics are smeared, correlated systematics are specificied using IsCorrelated option. |
| ReplacementFile              | allows usage of placeholders in the config, which will be overwritten by values provided in an external file; see Replacement file section in the README |
| CustomIncludePaths           | can be used in case the user wants to add include path(s) needed when reading custom-functions (same as typing `.include /path/to/include` before calling `.L myMacro.C`) |
| AllowWrongRegionSample       | Can be TRUE or FALSE (default). When set to TRUE code will print only warnings when chosen samples or regions for various options are not defined. When set to FALSE the code will print errors and stop when the samples/regions are not defined. |
| ScaleSamplesToData           | The specified samples will be scaled to data (when doing the d step). |
| MaxNtupleEvents              | valid only for option NTUP; if set to N, only first N entries per ntuple read (useful for debugging) |
| CustomFunctions              | list of .C files with definition and implementation of functions to be used in strings defining selections or weights (see this link: https://wiki.physik.uzh.ch/lhcb/root:ttreedraw, notice that the file and function names should match and that all the arguments of the function should have default values) |
| CustomFunctionsExecutes      | semicolon seperated list of functions to be executed right after the loading .C files, in case of any initialization step required before filling ntuples (can be set via a command line option 'CustomFunctionsExecutes') |
| MCweight                     | only for option NTUP; string defining the weight (for MC samples only) |
| Selection                    | only for option NTUP; string defining the selection |
| **Paths**                    | |
| HistoPath(s)                 | valid only for option HIST above is selected; it's the path(s) where the input root files containing the histograms are stored |
| HistoFile(s)                 | valid only for option HIST; it's the file name(s) where the input root files containing the histograms are stored |
| HistoName(s)                 | valid only for option HIST; it's the histogram name(s) to read from the file(s) |
| HistoNameNominal             | valid only for option HIST; name of the nominal histogram, in case the systematic histogram names cannot be build by suffixing but instead replace the nominal name. Behaves like HistoNameSuff for Systematics if Nominal was a Systematic |
| NtuplePath(s)                | valid only for option NTUP; it's the path(s) where the input root files containing the ntuples are stored |
| NtupleFile(s)                | valid only for option NTUP; it's the file names(s) where the input root files containing the ntuples are stored |
| NtupleName(s)                | valid only for option HIST; it's the tree name(s) to read from the file(s) |
| InputFolder                  | specify it to read fit input histograms from a different directory than `<jobName>/Histograms/` |
| InputName                    | specify it to read fit input histograms from files with different name than `<jobName>_blabla.root` |

| WorkspaceFileName            | if specified, an external ws can be used as input for fitting (not 100% supported) |
| Suffix                       | added to file names of plots, workspace, fit results etc. (equivalent to command line option) |
| SaveSuffix                   | added to file name of histograms, for usage with hupdate (equivalent to command line option) |

| ResponseMatrixName(s)        | Name(s) of the histogram for response matrix |
| ResponseMatrixFile(s)        | File path(s) of the histogram for response matrix |

| MigrationNameNominal         | Nominal histogram name |
| **Pruning**                  | |
| PruningType                  | Can be set to `BACKGROUNDREFERENCE` or `COMBINEDREFERENCE` (default is `SEPARATESAMPLE`), and pruning (both shape and norm) will be done w.r.t. to total-signal/total. |
| SystPruningShape             | Lower threshold to remove a shape systematic from the fit/limit (suppression is done per sample and per region) (e.g.: 0.02 for 2%) |
| SystPruningNorm              | Lower threshold to remove a normalisation systematic from the fit/limit (suppression is done per sample and per region) (e.g.: 0.02 for 2%) |
| SystLarge                    | All systematics above this threshold will be removed, unless `RemoveLargeSyst` is set to `FALSE`, then the systematics will be flagged in the pruning plot) (e.g. 0.4 will flag systematics that are larger than 40%). The default is -1, meaning no pruning. |
| RemoveLargeSyst              | Will prune systematics above threshold set by `SystLarge` if set to `TRUE` (default). It will remove both shape and norm component, effectively removing the systematic uncertainty for a given sample. |
| RemoveSystOnEmptySample      | If set to `TRUE`, will prune systematics for samples where nominal has integral < 1e-4.  Default is `FALSE` |
| PruningShapeOption           | Can be `MAXBIN` (Default) or `KSTEST`. `MAXBIN` checks if the systematic variation has at least one bin which is different compared to the nominal (variation is >= threshold). `KSTEST` runs the Kolmogorov test (using the `X` option, a.k.a running pseudoexperiments). When using `KSTEST`, if the probability is <= (1-threshold) then the systematic is marked as having shape component. |
| ShowValidationPruning        | If set to `TRUE` will show the pruning also in validation regions. Default is `FALSE`. |
| KeepPruning                  | if set to TRUE, the first time the ws is created (option w) a Pruning.root file is created under `<jobName>/` and used for future operations to skip pruned systematics (makes operations much faster in case many syst are pruned) |
| **Affecting Fit**            | |
| IntCodeOverall               | interpolation code used for the normalization component of systematics (should match the one used in RooStats) |
| IntCodeShape                 | interpolation code used for the shape component of systematics (should match the one used in RooStats) |
| MCstatThreshold              | by default, the MC stat uncertainty is included in the fit (and to the plots); a NP will be added for each bin with an MC stat uncertainty > this threshold (relative) if the option is set to a float (default: no threshold); can also set to NONE in order to disable MC stat uncertainty completely. If set to `NONE`, it will also disable the MC stat uncertainty from all samples with `SeparateGammas: TRUE`, effectively ignoring this option|
| MCstatConstraint             | constraint used for MC stat uncertainties, can be set to 'GAUSSIAN' or 'POISSON' (default) |
| StatOnly                     | the code ignores systematics and MC stat uncertainties from all computations (limits, significances, fit, ...); need to re-create ws in case of limit and significance |
| FixNPforStatOnly             | if set to TRUE, when running stat-only (with either of the two options) also the norm factors other than the POI are kept fixed |
| CustomAsimov                 | if set, the workspace will be created with an AsimovData built according to Sample->`AsimovReplacementFor` option (see below) instead of data |
| GuessMCStatEmptyBins         | For bins with negative yields, the yield is corrected to 1e-06. If a stat. uncertainty on that bin was defined, it is kept. If the stat. uncertainty was however 0, then this option kicks in. If it is set to TRUE (default), the smallest stat. uncertainty from any other bin in the distribution will be used. If set to FALSE, or if all other bins have no stat. uncertainty defined, a 100% uncertainty (of 1e-06) is applied instead. |
| DecorrSysts                  | comma-separated list of systematics which you want to decorrelate from another channel (this is done by automatically attaching a suffix to the NuisanceParameter for each of them); can use wildcards |
| DecorrSuff                   | the suffix to attach when using DecorrSysts |
| SmoothMorphingTemplates      | if set to TRUE (default is FALSE), the templates used for morphing are forced to have linear dependence on the morphing parameter, bin-by-bin (plots are produced per bin, in the Morphing directory) |
| PropagateSystsForMorphing    | if set to TRUE (default is FALSE), the non-nominal templates inherit all the systematics from the nominal template; NB: the nominal template is determined by the nominal value of the norm factor in the config |
| ExcludeFromMorphing          | The specified sample is left our from the morphing (useful to do closure tests for morphing). |
| AlternativeShapeHistFactory  | For systematic uncertainties defined via a single template and then symmetrized, there are two ways of building the (normalized) `HistoSys` template that enters `HistFactory`. By default, `TRExFitter` first symmetrizes the provided template, and then normalizes both resulting templates. If this option is set to TRUE (false by default), then the order of operations is switched. `TRExFitter` will first normalize the provided template to the same yield as nominal, and then symmetrize the resulting template. This means that the templates passed to `HistFactory` are symmetric, while by default they are not completely symmetric. (Note that this does not mean that the normalization effect is dropped from the systematic, it is handled separately in `HistFactory` as an `OverallSys`. |
| **Cosmetics**                | |
| UseGammaPulls                | if set to TRUE, the fit results in terms of gamma parameter pulls, constraints and correlations are propagated to the post-fit plots, when possible (i.e. not for validation plots of course) |

| SystDataPlots                | if set to TRUE, plots showing the shape effect of a given systematic (before and after smoothing/symmetrisation) on top of the nominal sum of samples will be produced. Data are then plotted in the ratio. If the option is set to "fillUpFrame", data will also be plotted in the upper frame. |

| SummaryPlotYmin              | if set, it will force the summary plot to use this value as min y-maxis value |
| SummaryLogY                  | Can be set to `TRUE` (default) or `FALSE`, controls the use of logarithmic scale on Y axis for summary plots |

Three possible options are available: LINEAR(default)/SMOOTHLINEAR/SQUAREROOT. All of these options basically use linear interpolation but SMOOTHLINEAR approximates it by integral of hyperbolic tangent and SQUAREROOT approximates it by $\sqrt{x^2+\epsilon}$ to achieve smooth transitions (first derivative) between the templates |
| BlindedParameters            | A comma separated list of POI/NPs that will be written as a hexadecimal number so it is not easy to read to not accidentally unblind. When at least one parameter is set the console output of the minimization is removed.
| DoNonProfileFitSystThreshold | When performing a NonProfileFit, systematics are not added to total if smaller than this threshold |

Quoting from the ROOT documentation: "(if set to true) Offset likelihood by initial value (so that starting value of FCN in minuit is zero). This can improve numeric stability in simultaneous fits with components with large likelihood values" |
| DataWeighted | If set to `TRUE` (default is `FALSE`), the code will modify all histograms (data and prediction) by scaling them bin-wise by N_Data/uncertainty_Data^2. This allows to use the current model (likelihood) even when weighted data are used (the do not follow Poisson ditribution if they are weighted) as the uncertainty of the modified data histograms is sqrt(N). Only the histograms entering the fit are affected. Note that this is valid only in the Gaussian approximation (approximately > 10 events in each bin). |

| HistoName(s)                 | only for option HIST, the histogram name (or names, comma-separated) to be used |
| HistoPathSuff(s)             | only for option HIST, the path suffix (or suffixes, comma-separated) where to find the histogram files for this region |
| Variable                     | only for option NTUP, the variable (or expression) inside the ntuple to plot can define a variable as X|Y to do the correlation plot between X and Y |

| Binning                      | if specified, the histograms will be binned according to the new binning specified, in the form like `0,10,20,50,100`. The parameter `AutoBin` allows to use algorithms to define the binning. Example - `Binning: "AutoBin","TransfoD",5.,6.` (`TransfoF` also available, `5.` and `6.` are parameters of the transformation; `TransfoJ` takes three parameters). A popular setting is `TransfoD` with both parameters set to the same value; the amount of bins used is equal to the sum of both parameters. If used in background region and zSig!=0 (first parameter, =0 gives flat background) then need a comma separated list of backgrounds to use instead of signal to compute the binning. More information about the automatic binning algorithms is found in the [FAQ](faq.md). |
| Rebinning                    | if specified, the histograms will be rebinned according to the new binning specified, in the form like `0,10,20,50,100`. Differently from the BInning option, this one performs the rebinning aftre the original histograms are created. This means that this option can changed (or removed) before running the b step. |
| BinWidth                     | if specified, two things are done: this number is used to decorate the y axis label and the bin content is scaled for bins with a bin width different from this number |
| BinLabels                    | if specified, bin labels are set according to provided comma separated list (list length must be equal to number of bins) |
| Type                         | can be SIGNAL, CONTROL or VALIDATION; used depending on Fit->FitType; if VALIDATION is set, the region is never fitted; default is SIGNAL |
| DataType                     | ASIMOV or DATA. Is ASIMOV is set in some of the regions and DATA in some other ones, limits, significance and final fit are computed without taking into account the data in this region, but creating a modified Asimov data-set through a projection of the fit performed in the regions with DATA only. NB: this "Mixed fit" feature only works if no NPValues option is set (see Fit->NPValues). |
| Ymax                         | if set, it will force the plot to use this value as max y-maxis value |
| Ymin                         | if set, it will force the plot to use this value as min y-maxis value |
| RatioYmax                    | if set, it will specify the max of the range of the ratio plot for this region only |
| RatioYmin                    | if set, it will specify the min of the range of the ratio plot for this region only |
| RatioYmaxPostFit             | if set, it will specify the max of the range of the ratio plot for this region only, for post-fit only |
| RatioYminPostFit             | if set, it will specify the min of the range of the ratio plot for this region only, for post-fit only |
| DropBins                     | Allows to specify a comma-separated list of bins where the yield will be set to 0 (both for data and prediction), starting from 1 for the index as is the ROOT convention for bin indices. This can be used to remove bins from the fit, for example to fit a background-only model without bins that have significant signal contamination. |
| AutomaticDropBins            | Set this to TRUE to automatically drop bins (= set yield to 0 for data and prediction) above the `BlindingThreshold`. Default setting is FALSE, and manual use of `DropBins` also sets this option to FALSE. When FALSE, the bins are still blinded in plots via `BlindingThreshold`, but they will enter the fit (unless manually removed with `DropBins`). |
| Group                        | if specified, regions of the same group appear together in several places, see RegionGroups option |
| YaxisTitle                   | title of y-axis used for plots of the region |
| YmaxScale                    | scales range of y-axis (default: 2.0, meaning the maximum axis value is twice the largest yield in any bin) |
| Ymax                         | maximum value on y-axis |
| SkipSmoothing                | if smoothing of nominal samples is used, this option can be used to disable smoothing per region (default: FALSE) |
| XaxisRange                   | Manually call 'SetRangeUser()' on X axis. Needs two parameters(floats): min,max |
| NumberOfRecoBins             | Number of reco bins in this region when Unfolding is used |
| IsBinOfRegion                | can be set in order to declare this region as corresponding to a certain bin of another region (to be set as VALIDATION region and to be declared previously in the config file); in this way, one can perform a two-dimensional fit, by keeping the systematic smoothing in both directions: for each systematic, the smoothing applied to the VALIDATION region indicated will be propagated to the overall part of the systematic variation in this region; syntax: "region-name":binNmbr (NB: bin numbering here starts at 1 due to technical reasons) |

| SeparateGammas               | if set to TRUE, the sample will not contribute to the overall gamma factors for MC stat, but a separate set of them will be added for this sample (through the SHAPE systematic technology); NB: you need to re-run the `n` or `h` step if you want to decorrelate the gammas on existing inputs (`wf` is not enough). If `MCstatThreshold` is set to `NONE`, this option is ignored |
| CorrelateGammasInRegions     | to be used only together with SeparateGammas; can be used to correlate MC stat across regions; example: "SR1:SR2,CR1:CR2:CR3" will use the same NP for the MC stat in each bin of SR1 and SR2 and in each bin of CR1, CR2 and CR3 |
| CorrelateGammasWithSample    | to be used only together with SeparateGammas; can be used to correlate MC stat of this sample with those of another sample (example usecase: when one sample is derived from another one through reweighting, and they are both used in the fit) |
| Morphing                     | add this to each template you have, to do a template fit / morphing; syntax is `<name-of-parameter>,<value-corresponding-to-this-template>`; the POI should be set to `<name-of-parameter>` |
| BuildPullTable               | if set to TRUE or NORM-ONLY, create tables showing the post-fit acceptance effect of nuisance parameter pulls for this sample, set to NORM+SHAPE to include the bin-by-bin effect |
| MCstatScale                  | scales up/down the MC stat size; useful to project sensitivity to larger MC samples |
| SystFromSample               | set it to TRUE (default FALSE) to have this sample inheriting all the systematics from another sample |
| UseGaussianShapeSysConstraint| set it to TRUE (default FALSE) will use Gaussian constraint term for the SHAPE systematics for this sample, e.g. when SeparateGammas: TRUE is used  |

| Expression                   | a way to correlate this norm factor with other norm factors (using AddPreprocessFunction); two arguments, in the form `<expression>:<dependencies>`, where `<dependencies>` should contain the names of the norm factors the expression depends on, their nominal values and existence ranges [example: `(1.+Pmag*cos(theta))/2.:Pmag[0.9,0,1],theta[0,0,3.14]`] |
| Tau                          | If set, a constraint term will be added to the likelihood for this NF, in the same way as for the Tikhonov regularization (used in unfolding); the constraint will be of the form exp(-(1/2) * tau^2 * (NF-µ)^2), where µ is the Nominal value for the NF, so the larger is tau, the stronger the constraint |

| SubCategory                  | minor category for the systematic, used to evaluate impact on POI per SubCategory in "i" step, defaults to Category setting if it is used, otherwise defaults to "Uncategorised", do not use "Gammas", "FullSyst", or "combine" as SubCategory names (reserved for special functionality) |
| CombineName                  | A unique string for each systematic that you want to combine into a single systematic (e.g.) envelope. This needs to be set for every systematic that needs to be combined. The code will then combine all systematic and modify the _first one_ and then set all other systematics manually to zero. This is executed during the `b` step. |
| CombineType                  | Can be `ENVELOPE`, `STANDARDDEVIATION` (divide by `N-1`), `STANDARDDEVIATIONNODDOF` (no delta degree of freedom, i.e. divide by `N`), `HESSIAN` (divide by `1`) or SUMINSQUARES. Tells the code how to combine the systematics with the same `CombineName`. `STANDARDDEVIATION`, `STANDARDDEVIATIONNODDOF`, and `HESSIAN` do OneSided symmetrisation while for `ENVELOPE` it is recommended to use the symmetrisation for the individual components. SUMINQUARES option will sum systematic uncertainties in squares (bin-by-bin) |

| Symmetrisation               | can be ONESIDED, TWOSIDED, ABSMEAN and MAXIMUM (...); for no symmetrisation, skip the line; ONESIDED = only one variation provided (e.g. up variation), down variation will be added as mirrored version, TWOSIDED = (up-down)/2 variation is calculated bin-by-bin, this is used as up variation and then mirrored to down variation, ABSMEAN = ((abs(up)+abs(down))/2) can be used when both variations have the same sign, USE WITH CAUTION, MAXIMUM = take variations with larger abs value w.r.t nominal and take this in each bin, can be used when both variations have the same sign, USE WITH CAUTION |
| Smoothing                    | smoothing code to apply; use 40 for default smoothing; for no smoothing, skip the line |
| OverallUp                    | for OVERALL systematic: the relative "up" shift (0.1 means +10%) |
| OverallDown                  | for OVERALL systematic: the relative "down" shift (-0.1 means -10%) |
| ScaleUp                      | for OVERALL, HISTO or SHAPE systematic: scale difference between "up" and nominal by a factor, or different factors for different regions (with the syntax `region1:1.2,region2:0.9`) |

| ReferenceSmoothing           | if this is specified, the syst variation is smoothed wrt a specified sample (Must appear in `Samples` for this syst) and then the smoothed variations are copied bin by bi to all other samples specified. Useful when `Morphing` is used |
| ReferencePruning             | if this is specified, the syst variation is pruned wrt a specified sample (Must appear in `Samples` for this syst) and then the same pruning is applied to all specified samples |
| DropShapeIn                  | specify regions or samples where you want the smoothing / pruning to be forced to drop the shape and keep only norm. When `all` is used, the shape is dropped for all regions and all samples |

| DropNormSpecial              | Only effective when `CombineName` is used to combine special systematics. A list of region names can be specified to drop the normalisation for the combined systematic in those regions. This option has to be used for at least one of the systematics that are being combined |

| NoPruning                    | Force the code to skip pruning for the systematic |
| PreSmoothing                 | if set to TRUE, a TH1::Smooth-based smoothing is applied, prior to the usual smoothing (if set) |
| SmoothingOption              | if not set smoothing option from Job option is taken.

| Decorrelate                  | decorrelate systematic, can take values REGION (decorrelate across regions), SAMPLE (decorrelate across samples), SHAPEACC (decorrelate shape and acceptance effects); can be used to change behaviour of a systematic without having to re-run the n or b step |
| ForceShape                   | Can be: `NOSHAPE` (default) - no changes to the uncertainty, `LINEAR` will create a linear shape from left up variation to bottom down variation ased on the original up and down variations or `TRIANGULAR` that will create a triangular shape that is increasing until the middle of the distribution and then decreasing back to 0. The other variation is symmetrised. |
