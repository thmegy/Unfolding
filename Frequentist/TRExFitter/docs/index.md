# Documentation for TRExFitter

![TRExFitter logo](img/TRExFitter_logo.png)

`TRExFitter` is a framework for binned template profile likelihood fits.
The code can be found on [GitLab](https://gitlab.cern.ch/TRExStats/TRExFitter).
This website collects documentation and tutorials for `TRExFitter`.
Navigate through the website with the panel on the left.

`TRExFitter` builds statistical models in [HistFactory](https://cds.cern.ch/record/1456844) format, take a look at description to learn more.
[RooFit](https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0306116) is the framework in which the statistical modeling is expressed, and [RooStats](https://arxiv.org/abs/1009.1003) provides additional classes for interval estimation and hypothesis testing.
Inference performed with `TRExFitter` relies on the methods discussed in [Asymptotic formulae for likelihood-based tests of new physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1007.1727).
There are many lecture notes available that provide additional information, one example is [Practical Statistics for the LHC](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.07622) by Kyle Cranmer.
